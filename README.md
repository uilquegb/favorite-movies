# Favorite movies

## What is this about?

This project is an experiment guided by [Udacity's Android Developer course](https://udacity.com/course/associate-android-developer-fast-track--nd818/).
And it's intended to show what I learned from this course.

## What can I do with this project?

You can install it in your Android device or emulator and try it on to see if it's good.
And if it is, please, let me know. If it doesn't, let me know too :smile:


## How can I install and run on my device/emulator?

You just need of a `API_KEY` from [**The Movie DataBase**](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started)  site in order to allow the app to use TMDB APIs.
To do so, you just have to follow some steps on the link above.

After that you must replace the value (`PUT_YOUR_APP_KEY_HERE`) inside `app/favorite-movies.properties` file by your API key (v3 auth).
